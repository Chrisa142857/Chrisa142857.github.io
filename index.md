# About me [[CV]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KbfENGCsAXfZWAdQUl0ReBLsKogCU1Ji/view?usp=sharing)

My Master was at Huazhong University of Science and Technology with advisor [Prof. Shaoqun Zeng](http://ses.hust.edu.cn/info/1092/1343.htm). My Bachelor was at Yunnan Normal University with advisor [Prof. Yang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7JLPFHgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

I am interested in medical image analysis and deep learning.

- _13/2/2023_: A paper is accepted by the conference IEEEISBI2023.

- _31/5/2022_: The last part in my master thesis, GC detection using its basic shape by deep learning, is preprint, and it is preparing to submit to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14625),[codes](https://github.com/Chrisa142857/PolarNet-GCdet)]

- _18/12/2021_: The C++ deployment of the preprint paper (under review) is released on [Github](https://github.com/Chrisa142857/You-Only-Look-Cytopathology-Once/tree/main/cpp). The speed is lower than `1 min/WSI` with the same computation in Python.
