# About me [[CV]](https://github.com/Chrisa142857/Chrisa142857.github.io/blob/main/assets/Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf)

I am a second-year Master student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My Advisor is Prof. [Shaoqun Zeng](http://ses.hust.edu.cn/info/1092/1343.htm).

I am interested in point set registration, image registration and deep learning, especially Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and whole slide image (WSI) analysis.

- _08/07/2021_: Results submitted via Email. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01175),[Leader's codes](https://github.com/sucv/ABAW2),[My PR codes](https://github.com/sucv/ABAW2/tree/prototype)] I have been working on an ongoing in-the-wild emotion recognition [competition](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/iccv-2021-2nd-abaw/) associated with **ICCV 2021**. Our model on the validation set significantly outperforms the baseline and the champion of last year.
