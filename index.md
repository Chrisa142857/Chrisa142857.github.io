# About me [[CV]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KbfENGCsAXfZWAdQUl0ReBLsKogCU1Ji/view?usp=sharing)

I am a final-year Master student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My Advisor is [Prof. Shaoqun Zeng](http://ses.hust.edu.cn/info/1092/1343.htm).

I am interested in point set registration, image registration and deep learning, especially Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and whole slide image (WSI) analysis.

- _18/12/2021_: The C++ deployment of the preprint paper (under review) is released on [Github](https://github.com/Chrisa142857/You-Only-Look-Cytopathology-Once/tree/main/cpp). The speed is lower than `1 min/WSI` with the same computation in Python.

- _15/07/2021_: Our team, FlyingPigs, got **5/40** in an emotion recognition [competition](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/iccv-2021-2nd-abaw/) published in **ICCV 2021**. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01175),[codes](https://github.com/sucv/ABAW2/tree/prototype),[leaderboard](https://github.com/dkollias/ABAW2-Results/blob/main/abaw2_va_leaderboard.pdf/)]
