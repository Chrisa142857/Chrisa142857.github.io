# About me

I am a second-year Master student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My Advisor is Prof. [Shaoqun Zeng](http://ses.hust.edu.cn/info/1092/1343.htm).

I am interested in point set registration, image registration and deep learning, especially Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and whole slide image (WSI) analysis.

Recently I have submitted a preprint paper, and have been working on an on-going in-the-wild emotion recognition competition associated with **ICCV 2021**. Our model on the validation set significantly outperforms the baseline and the champion of last year.
