# About me [[CV]](https://github.com/Chrisa142857/Chrisa142857.github.io/blob/main/assets/Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf)

I am a second-year Master student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My Advisor is Prof. [Shaoqun Zeng](http://ses.hust.edu.cn/info/1092/1343.htm).

I am interested in point set registration, image registration and deep learning, especially Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and whole slide image (WSI) analysis.

Recently I have submitted a preprint paper to the journal [Medical Image Analysis](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/medical-image-analysis), and have been working on an on-going in-the-wild emotion recognition competition associated with [ICCV 2021](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/iccv-2021-2nd-abaw/). Our model on the validation set significantly outperforms the baseline and the champion of last year.
