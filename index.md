# About me [[CV]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KbfENGCsAXfZWAdQUl0ReBLsKogCU1Ji/view?usp=sharing)

I am a second-year Master student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My Advisor is Prof. [Shaoqun Zeng](http://ses.hust.edu.cn/info/1092/1343.htm).

I am interested in point set registration, image registration and deep learning, especially Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and whole slide image (WSI) analysis.

- _15/07/2021_: Competition results announced, FlyingPigs got **5/40**. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01175),[codes](https://github.com/sucv/ABAW2/tree/prototype),[leaderboard](https://github.com/dkollias/ABAW2-Results/blob/main/abaw2_va_leaderboard.pdf/)] 

> I have been working on an ongoing in-the-wild emotion recognition [competition](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/iccv-2021-2nd-abaw/) associated with **ICCV 2021**. Our model on the validation set significantly outperforms the baseline, the champion of last year and most participants who published their paper in the arXiv. 

- _30/06/2021_: A preprint paper[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15113),[codes](https://github.com/Chrisa142857/You-Only-Look-Cytopathology-Once)] submitted to **Medical Image Analysis**.
